# Create Skyblock Tweaks!

Datapack for use in the Create Skyblock Infinite modpack, featuring recipes for generating otherwise unobtainable blocks and tweaks to the loot table for zombies, husks, and skeletons.

### Loot Table Changes
* Zombies have a chance to drop Andesite
* Husks have a chance to drop Sand. Iron Ingot chance has been replaced with Zinc Ingots
* Skeletons have a chance to drop copper, iron, zinc, or gold _nuggets_, with a slightly higher weighting for copper.

### Recipe Examples
* Asurine, Crimsite, Ochrum, and Veridium similar to crafting Andesite
* Renewable Netherrack
* A Charcoal > Coal > Coal Blocks + Lava > Diamonds loop
* Craftable Tuff
* Chance to crush Limestone and Scoria for copper and zinc nuggets, respectively
